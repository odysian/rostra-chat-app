# Playbook: Write a Spec

This is a portable procedural playbook. It is not runtime-loaded unless your tooling explicitly loads it.

When asked to create a Spec:

1. Confirm scope, non-goals, compatibility needs, risks, and verification commands.
2. Write concise sections:
- Summary
- Value/User impact
- In/out of scope
- Expected behavior
- Backend plan (if applicable)
- Frontend plan
- Files expected
- Tests/regression notes
- Decision Locks
- Acceptance criteria
3. Keep acceptance criteria testable.
4. Add explicit verification commands.
