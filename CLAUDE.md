# Agent entrypoint

Start here: `AGENTS.md`

Then read (in order):
- `WORKFLOW.md`
- `docs/ISSUES_WORKFLOW.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (if present)
- `docs/PATTERNS.md` (if present)
- `docs/REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md` (if present)
- `skills/*` (if present)
- `skills/spec-workflow-gh.md` (if present)

Rule: use GitHub issues as the default unit of work; quick-fix fast lane is allowed only under `docs/ISSUES_WORKFLOW.md` criteria.
